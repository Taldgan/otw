deals with argc & argv...
eventually '*(argv+4)' will be strpcy'd into a new variable *just* before return...
likely just a buffer overflow to change return address to shellcode or something else (system?)


checks if argv (I think) is printable and quits if it isn't
I think I need to write shellcode with bytes *only* in the printable range o_o
could write it and use the SUB shellcode thing

seems to have to be shorter than 511 bytes

Got output with testing with one byte \0x02 as argv[1]... 
'Non-alpha chars found in string, possible shellcode!'
