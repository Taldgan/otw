Took a bit of learning about the basics of sockets, and some time reading the decompiled code from behemoth5 but it is done!

behemoth5 does a few weird things that gave me trouble.

The first is using 'fseek' and 'ftell', the latter of which determines how many
bytes to read in a file (in this case), and the former sets where in the file
the stream is.

After this, it opens a socket using socket(2, 2, 0) (which turned out to be DGRAM IP) with the host being localhost... 

lastly it set the port to 1337! 

Since it read in /etc/behemoth_pass/behemoth6 in before the fseek and ftell parts,
it sends that data over the socket to a service listening on that port.
Just had to run the file with a netcat server running

'nc -l -u -p 1337'
