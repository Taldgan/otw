This level is pretty simple, and its purpose (as far as I can tell) is to highlight weaknesses in php.

The main (and only) chunk of php is this v
__________________________________________________________
<?php
    if(array_key_exists("passwd",$_REQUEST)){
        if(strstr($_REQUEST["passwd"],"iloveyou") && ($_REQUEST["passwd"] > 10 )){
            echo "<br>The credentials for the next level are:<br>";
            echo "<pre>Username: natas24 Password: <censored></pre>";
        }
        else{
            echo "<br>Wrong!<br>";
        }
    }
    // morla / 10111
?>

At first glance, the password has to equal "iloveyou" but also be larger than ten??? How does that work.

Well, strstr() actually returns the first instance of a the string supplied in the parameter and all of the string that follows after!

For example:

strstr("iloveyoutaldgan", "you") would return "youtaldgan"

Essentially, this means that you can put (in the level's case) whatever you want in front of "iloveyou", and the password will still equal "iloveyou".


The second piece of knowledge needed to beat the level is understanding how the comparison (>) operator works with strings.

Since it is comparing a string (passwd) with an integer (10), PHP will convert the string into an integer if it can.

In php, according to the manual, "bob3" converted to an int would be 0, but "3bob" would be equivalent to 3 once converted!

So in order to solve this level, you only need to supply an integer larger than 10 in front of the string "iloveyou" to beat it!

In my case, sending the request http://natas23.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?passwd=11iloveyou beats the level.

Php is pretty weird.
