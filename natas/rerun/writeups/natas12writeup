This level prompts you to upload a JPEG file, after which it creates a random link to the image that you can click on
and view. (http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/uploads/xxxxxxx.jpg)

When you check the source code, you can see that the php doesn't check what type of file you actually uploaded,
and you can change the name (and thereby url) of the uploaded file with a 'filename' component of the post request.

As such, you can write a php file to 'cat' out the password for natas13

i.e.:

<?php
    passthru('cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas12');
?>

Name the file, upload that as the image, and change the file extension in the post request to .php.

Once uploaded, you can click on the file to execute the php and display natas13's password!
