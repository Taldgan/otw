Very similar to the last level, except it requires you to get command execution.

For some reason it is quite buggy, only letting certain commands work with multiple arguments (and being overall a buggy mess).

Either way, eventually after enough experimentation, I figured out that you can get ls to work if you also pass '.' so you have:

`index.pl?ls%20.%20|`

This lists the webroot where a file 'getpassword.c' and a binary 'getpassword' exists.

run `index.pl?./getpassword%20|` and it dumps out natas33's pass! Almost done!!!
