The gist of this level is understanding and abusing the concept of PHP session IDs.

Checking the source code of the level, you can see that a number (640) of available session ID's is allocated for the logins.

The solution, therefore, is to quite literally iterate through all 640 PHPSESSID's until you access the webpage
with one that is assigned to a valid admin login. That's it!
