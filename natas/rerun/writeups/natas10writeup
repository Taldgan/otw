This level is very similar to the last one, except now the input you provide is filtered!

This means you can't use ;, add comments, or anything.

Fortunately, the php command STILL uses grep.

Because grep allows you to search for one character in multiple files, all you have to do is find a character

that is inside of the natas11 password, (c) and pass that in along with /etc/natas_webpass/natas11

as such, by searching for 'c /etc/natas_webpass/natas11', you get the next password!
