This level prompts you with a textfield that allows you to input a "secret".

If you input the wrong secret, you get "wrong secret" as the output

	<?

		include "includes/secret.inc";

		if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
			if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
				print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
			} else {
				print "Wrong secret";
			}
		}
	?>

Upon inspecting the source code, this segment of php stands out.

"include" in php indicates a path to a php file containing php you want to import into your script.

The argument after is the path to the included php file, in this case "includes/secret.inc".

In order to view this file, you go to "http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc/"

There it gives you this segment of PHP, where the "secret" value is assigned.
<?
	$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>
Upon inputting that into the submit field (using a POST request) by hand/script, the password is given.
