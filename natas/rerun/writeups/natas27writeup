Weird level.


This level prompts you with a username/password field. If a new user is put in, a new user is created.

Once logged in, it reveals the username/password for the account that gets logged in.

This level is pretty damn difficult in that all of the input is properly sanitized regarding characters,
and the php itself isn't inherently flawed. 

Honestly out of all the levels, this one seems the most secure - minus one mistake.

When the database is created using VARCHAR(64), the column character limit is thereby 64.

The way VARCHAR works in MySQL, if trailing spaces exceed the character limit, the string is truncated cutting off everything until the end.


Inorder to complete this level, you must bypass the login by creating a fake natas28 user whose username is equivalent to the actual natas28, but lets you login anyway.

The way to do that is to pass in 'natas28_______________________________________________________a' with any character at the end of enough spaces to make the length of the username over 64. That'll generate a fake natas28 user. Then, you can remove the extraneous character at the end to login as natas28, yielding the creds. Strange.
