This one is similar to the last, the main hint being

"No more information leaks, nothing even Google will find."

Although the knowledge for this is kind of specific, the idea is "why wouldn't Google find an 'information leak'"

The answer is the robots.txt file most webservers have, that indicates whether or not specific folders should be indexed
by a search engine or not.

Upon looking at 'http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt/'

you find

   User-agent: *
   Disallow: /s3cr3t/

The above "Disallow" portion indicates any folders not to be indexed (such as /s3cr3t/)

Upon visiting s3cr3t you find the password for natas4
