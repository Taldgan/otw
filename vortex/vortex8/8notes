main:
- spawn 'safecode' thread
- set guid & uid to real uid/gid using SYSCALLS
- make call to 'unsafecode' (strcpy buf overflow)

- Since the syscall setresid & setresgid are used instead of the libc functions, only the main thread is impacted
- Safecode thread is a while loop that does printf("%d", 0)->fflush(stdout),sleep(1)
- From unsafecode we should somehow be able to impact & exploit privileged/elevated 'safecode' thread to spawn a shell
- Overwrite format string? GOT entry? idk
