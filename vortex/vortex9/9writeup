Weird one - not sure what it's purpose is?

I couldn't find a vortex9 in the normal location (/vortex)
so I searched the server for a vortex9 file

find / -type f -iname 'vortex9' 2>/dev/null

This outputted 2 paths - the password file (/etc/vortex_pass/vortex9),
but also a vortex9 file in /var/spool/mail/vortex9.

file /var/spool/mail/vortex9 revealed it to be ascii,
and catting it revealed the password for vortex10... huh.
