Basic level.

Running vortex5 prompts for a password - if you input the right one, it grants a shell.
If not, it outputs 'Incorrect password'.

The way it works it uses getpass() to obtain user input, then it performs an MD5 hash on
the user input password. If the hash matches the precomputed hash in the C file, you're netted
a privileged shell.

For this level, we're told the password is 5 characters (a-zA-Z0-9).

Like a moron, I chose to take a vastly more complicated route than necessary to solve this level.

Using inter-process communication with forking, pipes, and dup2 I wrote a C program
that bruteforces the password.

Really, the easier solution is to google or use a pre-established hash cracker tool and/or
website.

Either way, cracking the hash will give you the password, or you can brute-force it.

Then you get your shell and can cat out the password for vortex 6.
