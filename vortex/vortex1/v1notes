ptr is = to (buf*1.5), and it's location in buf gets altered by user input...

Each time loop is ran,

- '\n' prints buf & ptr
- '\\' decreases ptr loc by 1
- anything else gets inserted into ptr loc, and increases ptr by 1
- EOF ends prog...
- goal is to set ptr & 0xff000000 to 0xca000000
ptr cannot exceed buf+sizeof(buf)... so can't overwrite return address
