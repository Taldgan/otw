Reverse CRC32? Supposedly can return any desired CRC32 hash by appending 4 bytes
to the end of whatever message we desire.

Helpful: http://www.danielvik.com/2010/10/calculating-reverse-crc.html

crc32.py reverse 0x5008344d

- executing that and inputting one of the resulting strings resulted in no output from vortex 7! YES.

Now to use ReverseCRC from the danielvik to find bytes to append to a string

With the shellcode at 0xffffdfbf, the string "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIJJJJKKKKLLLLMMMMNNNNOOOOPPPPQQQQRRRRSS""\xBF\xDF\xFF\xFF""TTUUUUVVVVWWWWXXXXYYYYZZZZ0hlAcF" successfully hashes to 0xe1ca95ee and overwrites the return address of main! Nice.


As per usual, I wrote a local wrapper to execute the bin with a clean environment, and one for the server as well.
