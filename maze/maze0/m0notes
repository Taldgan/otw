^ make this file a symblic link to /etc/maze_pass/maze1
maze0 will read the password and dump it to stdout.
(or so I thought... access actually follows symbolic links (of course)...)
Since access is used BEFORE setresuid, the file being accessed needs read permissions for maze0....
not sure where to go with this yet.

tried:
 - physical links
 - symbolic link to a symbolic link
